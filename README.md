#### Mono- and Dual-Regulated Contractive-Expansive-Contractive Deep Convolutional Networks for Classification of Multispectral Remote Sensing Images

We present a mono- and dual-regulated contractive-expansive-contractive (MRCEC/DRCEC) CNN architecture. In particular, our contributions are as follows.

- We propose an approach composed of two parts, a mono-regulated convolutional architecture and a dual-regulated convolutional architecture.

- We design a specific neural network in which one master encoding convolutional network controls the decoding and encoding convolutional networks to incorporate the original input information.
